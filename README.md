# User-Stories-Allocation-using-Clustering-based-approach

This project introduces a novel clustering-based approach for allocating user stories to sprints in agile software development. The allocation of user stories based on their corresponding story point values is a critical task that affects project planning and resource allocation. The proposed approach employs clustering algorithms to group user stories with similar effort requirements, enabling the formation of well-balanced sprints that maximize productivity and resource efficiency. By using unsupervised machine learning methods like DBSCAN and K-Means clustering, the approach automatically identifies clusters of user stories. A comprehensive experimentation methodology evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comparing various clustering algorithms in terms of performance and cluster cohesion. The results demonstrate the advantages of this clustering-based approach, allowing teams to better plan and allocate resources, meet sprint goals, and deliver high-quality software within the allocated time frame. Overall, this research contributes a practical and effective method for sprint backlog allocation in agile software development, enhancing the existing knowledge base in the field.
